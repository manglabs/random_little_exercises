# Exercise 5

## Reading 

A "data structure", as the name suggests, is a way that your programming language provides for structuring -- organizing -- your data. 

Most modern programming languages provide convenient ways to use data structures with names like this:

* arrays
* hashes
* sets
* stacks
* queues
* trees

Many of them have real-world analogues, like a stack of dishes, or a queue of people waiting in line, or an ordered list of items, or links in a chain, etc.

Knowing about common data structures and at least a few of their associated common algorithms is part of being a good programmer. So you are going to learn and become very comfortable with all of these common `data structures` as time goes on. 

For now, let's focus on Arrays.

Arrays are one of the most important and useful data structures, so we'll be spending a lot of time on them.

In doing the exercise, you'll want to open up this page for reference:
