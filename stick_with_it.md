**Don't worry** if you aren't sure what the solution is, off the top of your head. 

Don't worry, and at the same time: **don't give up**.

Here's a hard but liberating truth about programming: You will *never* reach a state where you always have the answers off the top of your head, even if you code every day for the next 10 years. You will always, always, always find things that stump you at first, or you can't quite recall. 

Therefore, in order to succeed at programming, you have to actively build up your faith and resilience. You *will* get to the solution if you stick with it. That resilience is actually the foundational skill to hone, and it's not a purely left-brained/logical skill, despite programming's reputation as being nothing but that. If you don't have resilience, you won't get to learn the other stuff. Fear, frustration, and despair will cloud your vision and your mind, and make failure a foregone conclusion. 

To combat the FUD inherent to programming, you have to:

* understand yourself and your motivations and your habits/foibles well enough to psyche yourself _into_ doing the work, rather than _out_ of it
* become comfortable with some things (maybe _everything_) being unknown at first
* give yourself time to experiment and learn about the problem space
* over time hone your intuition for what _probably_ is right, based on your ever-improving mental models about how things generally work.
* work hard on improving those mental models
* work hard on improving your fluency with the tools you have chosen to use (platforms, languages, frameworks, libraries, utility apps, etc)

Most people only focus consciously on that very last point. Great masses of people think to themselves, "I need to learn JavaScript!". Ok, you need to learn JavaScript... but that won't happen if you psyche yourself out of the game.

Building your programming chops is in large part a giant exercise in building your spiritual and mental toughness, first and foremost. You have to be able to handle fear and confusion and near-overwhelming complexity, to keep your wits and focus steadily trained on the problem so you can solve it (and then the next problem, and the next problem, and the next problem...)

This actually is pretty similar to how we learn _anything_ non-trivial. In that sense, programming is a powerful meta-discipline that helps you become a more effective person.
