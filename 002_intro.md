To give yourself some more tools to (potentially) use here, take a quick glance at ...

* [arrays](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html)
* [random numbers](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Kernel.html#method-i-rand)

### Hints

Take a look at `002_sample.rb` for some hints. Note -- this is not a complete solution! Make sure to follow the exercise instructions above... Then make your own edits to `002_exercise.rb`.

### Questions

* What is the sample code doing?
* You don't _have_ to use an array for this -- can you think of another way to accomplish the same thing?
* What, if anything, confused you?
