# Exercise 4

## tl;dr
Make the exact same game as in exercise 3! (or a fresh variant, if that's more fun) But this time, don't peek!

## details

Try to do as much as you can without looking back at the code samples (either the original sample or your revised version).

Instead, look at the References section below and use these keywords to assemble your game. You can use the doc links to recall how stuff works.

You probably won't remember everything, and that's ok! Try your best to reconstruct things from memory, and when you have to go look at the source samples, try to grab as little as possible to unblock yourself. Also, only use your memory and typing, no copy/paste allowed! If you have to peek a lot, that's fine -- no need to beat yourself up. Unless you just like beating on yourself, whatever tickles your pickle, man. That's exactly the kind of freedom our Founding Fathers had in mind.
